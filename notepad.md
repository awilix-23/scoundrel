# Modifiers

Modifiers will multiply the game score. Additive or multiplicative ?

+ Aces strike first
+ Clubs always break weapon if they are greater than durability
+ No running
+ No power-ups
+ Room size increased to 5
* Include Jokers (shopkeepers)
- Allow durability "reset" from attacking a stronger enemy again
- Look through the discard pile
- Preview the card drawn from shop

# The Shop

+ Choose one from either Hearts or Diamonds pile; the card's value is random
+ Buy a consumable power-up

# Power-Ups

+ Two-prong: Deal half-damage to another card without taking damage
+ Reshuffle: Shuffle the remaining deck
+ Resurrect: Bring back the most recent discarded weapon

# Running Away

+ Scoop room cards in different ways to manipulate when you will re-face them
+ Running can only be done at the start of the game

# Score

+ Reward having *more, high-value* cards at the end
+ Reward using low-value diamonds to mend to a higher durability
+ Hearts are worth 1.5x
